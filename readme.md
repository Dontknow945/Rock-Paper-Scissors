Make a simple implementation of grade-school classic “rock paper scissors” using javascript.
## How this works
* Use prompt() to get input from users.
* The inputs are case-insensitive.
* Computer's choice is randomly decided.
* After playing 5 rounds, see who's the final winner.
* All the results will be displayed in the console.
